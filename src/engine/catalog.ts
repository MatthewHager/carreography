//   grid      what it locks to:
//               note   the transcribed notes
//               beat   the tracked beats at the level's pace (every one, 1 and 3, or the downbeat)
//               bar    the tracked downbeats, a whole bar at a time
//               self   its own timing (a cadence's chords, the Toccata's motif, a trill)
//
// Every move lights the whole lineup and grows with the level (level.ts): at a hush a single lamp a hit,
// from drive up whole halves of cars with their headlights, but for those the beat plays (pulse.ts).
// Written for the classic lineup, Model Y | Cybertruck | Model Y: "the truck" is the Cybertruck nearest the
// middle, "the Ys" every other car.
